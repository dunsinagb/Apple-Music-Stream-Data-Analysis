# Apple-Music-Stream-Data-Analysis

We will investigate my personal music streaming statistics from Apple Music in this study. Apple Music is an Apple Inc. music and video streaming service. The dataset utilized in this example represents my own streaming on the site.

Many things are visible in the dataset, like as

- List of songs performed

- Singers and Artists

- Music labels, start times and positions, and much more.

This information was obtained from Apple's privacy page.
